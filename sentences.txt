hello my name is elon musk
i am owner of twitter and spacex
i am over 50 years old
it is said that if you want to be successfull you need to work hard no matter what
sometimes to take a leap forward we need to leave a few things behind
i once killed a man not physically but psychologically 
if you think my jokes are bad you should see my comunication skills with women
i think we all should become memers because we have fun and made fun of
if you think that breakup is the worst then you probabily haven't appeared for an exam which requires you to fill an omr sheet
if money was found hanging on trees maybe girls would have monkey-boyfriends instead of human ones
